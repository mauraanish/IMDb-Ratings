# IMDb-Ratings
In the Fall 2023 semester, my final project for my MATH 398: Machine Learning class at Wheaton College (MA), which I took with Dr. Michael Kahn, used machine learning to predict the ratings of the Top 1,000 movies on IMDb. The initial dataset was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/digvijaysinhgohil/imdb-dataset-toprated-films-18982022).

### Files
- MLFinal.R: the R code used to build the 5 different supervised learning models 
- IMDbData.xlsx: the original data about the IMDb Top 1000 movies with 8 columns, prior to cleaning or transformation
- IMDb_Data_New.xlsx: the data about 100 movies not included in the IMDb Top 1000 with 10 columns, manually built
- ML Final Project Writeup.pdf: the summary of the project's goals, methodology, and results
